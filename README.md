# Workshop 9 : Live Video

[Website Link] 

## Task
[] Make an experimental 'smart mirror' using live video capture.<br>
[] Include manipulations at the level of the pixel.<br>

## Notes from the workshop video

createCapture() : allows us to take video from a webcam or any attached video device. -> we can pulish our sketches online, the sketch would incorporate video from the user's webcam.


## Progress (Experimentation and problem solving)

I had three error signs in my sketches. I needed to figure out what mistake I have been made but it was not easy to find it out. Finally, I have found that I have made some mistakes with the brackets. I needed to remove the curly bracket in line 36 and add a closing curly bracket to line 60.
